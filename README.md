## How does this work

This extension modifies the User Agent of the request to look like its coming from an actual TV (In this case, a [2023 Samsung TV running Tizen 7.0](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/guides/fundamentals/retrieving-platform-information.html)). It modifies the HTTP request headers
